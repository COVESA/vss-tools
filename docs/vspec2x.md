# vspec2x converters

vspec2x is a family of VSS converters that share a common codebase.

As a consequence it provides general commandline parameters guiding the parsing of vspec, as well as parameters specific to specific output formats.

You can get a description of supported commandline parameters by running `vspec2x.py --help`.

This documentation will give some examples and elaborate more on specific parameters.

The supported arguments might look like this

 ```
usage: vspec2x.py [-h] [-I dir] [-e EXTENDED_ATTRIBUTES] [-s] [--abort-on-unknown-attribute] [--abort-on-name-style]
                  [--format format] [--uuid] [--no-uuid] [--no_expand] [-o overlays] [-u unit_file]
                  [-vt vspec_types_file] [-ot <types_output_file>]
                  [--json-all-extended-attributes] [--json-pretty]
                  [--yaml-all-extended-attributes] [-v version] [--all-idl-features] [--gqlfield GQLFIELD GQLFIELD]
                  <vspec_file> <output_file>
```

An example command line to convert the VSS standard catalog into a JSON file is

```
% python vspec2x.py --format json  -I ../spec -u ../spec/units.yaml ../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec vss.json
Output to json format
Known extended attributes:
Reading unit definitions from ../spec/units.yaml
Loading vspec from ../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec...
Calling exporter...
Generating JSON output...
Serializing compact JSON...
All done.
```

This assumes you checked out the [COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification](https://github.com/covesa/vehicle_signal_specification) which contains vss-tools including vspec2x as a submodule.

The `-I` parameter adds a directory to search for includes referenced in you `.vspec` files. `-I` can be used multiple times to specify more include directories. The `-u` parameter specifies the unit file to use.

The first positional argument - `../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec` in the example  - gives the (root) `.vspec` file to be converted. The second positional argument  - `vss.json` in the example - is the output file.

The `--format` parameter determines the output format, `JSON` in our example. If format is omitted `vspec2x` tries to guess the correct output format based on the extension of the second positional argument. Alternatively vss-tools supports *shortcuts* for community supported exporters, e.g. `vspec2json.py` for generating JSON. The shortcuts really only add the `--format` parameter for you, so

```
python vspec2json.py  -I ../spec -u ../spec/units.yaml ../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec vss.json
```

is equivalent to the example above.

## General parameters

### --abort-on-unknown-attribute
Terminates parsing when an unknown attribute is encountered, that is an attribute that is not defined in the [VSS standard catalogue](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/), and not whitelisted using the extended attribute parameter `-e` (see below).

*Note*: Here an *attribute* refers to VSS signal metadata sich as "datatype", "min", "max", ... and not to the VSS signal type attribute

###  --abort-on-name-style
Terminates parsing, when the name of a signal does not follow [VSS recomendations](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/basics/#naming-conventions).

### --strict
Equivalent to setting `--abort-on-unknown-attribute` and `--abort-on-name-style`

### --uuid
Request the exporter to output uuids. This setting may not apply to all exporters, some exporters will never output uuids.
This is currently the default behavior. From VSS 4.0 `--no-uuid` will be the default behavior.

### --no-uuid
Request the exporter to not output uuids.
From VSS 4.0 this will be the default behavior and then this parameter will be deprecated.

### --no-expand

By default all tools expand instance information so that instance information like "Row1" become a branch just like
any other branch. If this argument is used and the exporter supports it no expansion will take place.
Instead instance information will be kept as additional information for the branch.

## Handling of Data Types

COVESA supports a number of pre-defined types, see [VSS documentation](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/data_entry/data_types/).
In addition to this COVESA is introducing a concept to support user-defined types.
This is currently limited to specifying struct-types. For more information on syntax see VSS documentation.

*Note: Struct support is not yet supported by all exporters, currently supported by JSON; CSV, Yaml and Protobuf exporters!*

To use user-defined types the types must be put in a separate file and given to the tool with the `-vt` argument.
When a signal is defined the tooling will check if the `datatype` specified is either a predefined type or
a user-defined type. If no matching type is found an error will be given.
It is possible to use `-vt <file>` multiple times. Any additional files after the first one is then treated similar
to overlay files, i.e. they are merged into previous file and it is if needed possible to redefine already defined types.

Depending on exporter, type definitions may either be transformed to a separate file with structure similar to the
"normal" output file, or integrated into the "normal" output file. If type output is given to a separate file then
the name of that file can be specified by the `-ot`argument.

Below is an example using user-defined types for JSON generation.
Please see [test cases](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools/tree/master/tests/vspec/test_structs) for more details.

```bash
python vspec2json.py --no-uuid --json-pretty -vt VehicleDataTypes.vspec -ot VehicleDataTypes.json test.vspec out.json
```

Current status for exportes:

* CSV, JSON, YAML, Protobuf: Supported!
* All other exporters: Not supported!

The export format is similar to the export format of VSS signals. The below table illustrates the exporting of the new nodes introduced in the data type tree:

| Data                     | CSV    | JSON | YAML |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Struct Node Attribute    | Column | Key  | Key  |
| Property Node Attribute  | Column | Key  | Key  |

The YAML exporter maintains the file structure of the vspec file being exported.

**NOTE:** For YAML and JSON, if a separate output file is not provided, the complex data types are exported under the key - `ComplexDataTypes`. See the snippets below for illustration.

**CSV snippet**
```csv
"Node","Type","DataType","Deprecated","Unit","Min","Max","Desc","Comment","Allowed","Default"
"<BranchName>","branch","","<Deprecation>","","","","<Description>","<Comment>","",""
"<StructName>","struct","","<Deprecation>","","","","<Description>","<Comment>","",""
"<PropertyName>","property","<DataType>","<Deprecation>","<Unit>","<Min>","<Max>","<Description>","<Comment>","<Allowed values>","<Default Value>"
```

**JSON snippet (data types are exported to a separate file)**
```json
{
  "VehicleDataTypes": {
    "children": {
      "<Branch>": {
        "children": {
          "<Struct>": {
            "children": {
              "<Property>": {
                "type": "property",
                "datatype": "<Data Type>",
                "description": "<Description",
                ...
              }
            },
            "description": "<Description>",
            "type": "struct"
          }
        }
        "description": "<Description>",
        "type": "branch"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**JSON snippet (signals and data types are exported to a single file)**
```json
{
  "Vehicle": {
    "type": "branch"
    // Signal tree
  },
  "ComplexDataTypes": {
    "VehicleDataTypes": {
      // complex data type tree
      "children": {
        "<Branch>": {
          "children": {
            "<Struct>": {
              "children": {
                "<Property>": {
                  "type": "property",
                  "datatype": "<Data Type>",
                  "description": "<Description",
                  //                  ...
                }
              },
              "description": "<Description>",
              "type": "struct"
            }
          }
          "description": "<Description>",
          "type": "branch"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Handling of units

The tooling verifies that only pre-defined units are used, like `kPa`and `percent`.

COVESA maintains a [unit file](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/blob/master/spec/units.yaml) for the standard VSS catalog.

It is possible to specify your own unit file(s) by the `-u <file>` parameter.
`-u` can be used multiple times to specify additional files like in the example below:

```bash
python ./vss-tools/vspec2csv.py -I ./spec -u vss-tools/vspec/config.yaml -u vss-tools/vspec/extra.yaml --no-uuid ./spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec output.csv
```

When deciding which units to use the tooling use the following logic:

* If `-u <file>` is used then the specified unit files will be used. Default units will not be considered.
* If `-u` is not used the tool will check for a unit file in the same directory as the root `*.vspec` file.

See the [FAQ](../FAQ.md) for more information on how to define own units.

## Handling of overlays and extensions
`vspec2x` allows composition of several overlays on top of a base vspec, to extend the model or overwrite certain metadata. Check [VSS documentation](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/introduction/) on the concept of overlays.

Overlays are in general injected before the VSS tree is expanded. Expansion is the process where branches with instances are transformed into multiple branches.
An example is the `Vehicle.Cabin.Door` branch which during expansion get transformed into `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left`, `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row1.Right`, `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row2.Left`and `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row2.Right`.

If you in an overlay for example wants to add a new signal to all door instances but only wants to specify the new signal once, then you could create an overlay like below and inject it using the `-o` or `--overlay` parameter.

```
Vehicle.Cabin.Door.NewSignal:
  datatype: int8
  type: sensor
  unit: km
  description: A new signal for all doors.
```

This will result in that the following new signals are created

* `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left.NewSignal`
* `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row1.Right.NewSignal`
* `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row2.Left.NewSignal`
* `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row2.Right.NewSignal`

If you only want to add the new signal to one of the doors, then you can create an overlay like below.

```
Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left.NewSignal:
  datatype: int8
  type: sensor
  unit: km
  description: A new signal for the left door on first row.
```

The tooling will recognize that `Row1.Left` refers to an instance of `Door` and will not expand the signal.
Even if a row not existing in standard instantiation is used (like `Row5`) the tool will recognize it as an "already expanded"
signal and not expand it further. If using an overlay to redefine a specific signal then data specified in overlays for extended signals
(like `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left.IsChildLockActive`) has precedence over data specified for not yet extended signals
(like `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.IsChildLockActive`).

*Note: If using `--no-expand` together with overlays for specific instances then the result will be a combination*
*of expanded and unexpanded paths. For the example above `Vehicle.Cabin.Door.Row1.Left.NewSignal` will be expanded*
*but all other signals in `Vehicle.Cabin.Door` will remain unexpanded!*

It is possible to use `-o` multiple times, e.g.

```
python vspec2yaml.py ../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec -o o1.vspec -o o2.vspec -oae o3.vspec -oae o4.vspec result.yml
```

You can also use overlays to inject custom metadata not used in the standard VSS catalog, for example if your custom VSS model includes `source` and `quality` metadata for sensors.
As an example consider the following `overlay.vspec`:

```yaml
#
# Example overlay
#
Vehicle:
  type: branch

Vehicle.Speed:
    quality: 100
    source: "ecu0xAA"
```

This will give a warning about unknown attributes, or even terminate the parsing when `-s`, `--strict`  or `--abort-on-unknown-attribute` is used.

```
% python vspec2json.py -I ../spec ../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec --strict -o overlay.vspec test.json
Output to json format
Known extended attributes:
Loading vspec from ../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec...
Applying VSS overlay from overlay.vspec...
Warning: Attribute(s) quality, source in element Speed not a core or known extended attribute.
You asked for strict checking. Terminating.
```

You can whitelist extended metadata attributes using the `-e` parameter with a comma separated list of attributes:

```
python vspec2json.py -I ../spec ../spec/VehicleSignalSpecification.vspec -e quality,source -o overlay.vspec test.json
```

In this case the expectation is, that the generated output will contain the whitelisted extended metadata attributes, if the exporter supports them.

__Note: Not all exporters (need to) support (all) extended metadata attributes!__ Currently, the `yaml` and `json` exporters support arbitrary metadata.

## JSON exporter notes

### --json-all-extended-attributes
Lets the exporter generate _all_ extended metadata attributes found in the model. By default the exporter is generating only those given by the `-e`/`--extended-attributes` parameter.

### --json-pretty
If the paramter is set it will pretty-print the JSON output, otherwise you will get a minimized version

## YAML exporter notes

### --yaml-all-extended-attributes
Lets the exporter generate _all_ extended metadata attributes found in the model. By default the exporter is generating only those given by the `-e`/`--extended-attributes` parameter.

## DDS-IDL exporter notes
The DDS-IDL exporter never generates uuid, i.e. the `--uuid` option has no effect.

## Graphql exporter notes
The Graphql exporter never generates uuid, i.e. the `--uuid` option has no effect.

### --all-idl-features
Will also generate non-payload const attributes such as unit/datatype. Default is not to generate them/comment them out because at least Cyclone DDS and FastDDS do not support const. For more information check the [DDS-IDL exporter docs](VSS2DDSIDL.md).

## GRAPHQL exporter notes

### --gqlfield GQLFIELD GQLFIELD
Add additional fields to the nodes in the graphql schema. use: <field_name> <description>


## Writing your own exporter
This is easy. Put the code in file in the [vssexporters directory](../vspec/vssexporters/).

Mandatory functions to be implemented are
```python
def add_arguments(parser: argparse.ArgumentParser):
```

and

```python
def export(config: argparse.Namespace, root: VSSNode):
```
See one of the existing exporters for an example.

Add your exporter module to the `Exporter` class in [vspec2x.py](../vspec2x.py).

## Design Decisions and Architecture
